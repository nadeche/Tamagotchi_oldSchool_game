  Tamagotchi old school game 1.0 - This app shows one number, between 1 - 10, on the screen
  and asks the user to gues if the other number(between 1 -10) will be higher or lower. 
  If the numbers are equal, the player always loses. 
  Inspired by the old school tamagotchi mini game from the 90's.
